# Login Server Popup - Overview

## Purpose
Show a modal popup when user logs into a server, displaying server information and welcome content.

## Requirements
- Auto-show on server login (first join or switching servers)
- Display 5 fields: server name, banner image, server time, MOTD, custom welcome message
- User can dismiss with X button
- User can reopen via server icon button click
- Remember dismissal per server (localStorage)
- Design for future extensibility (announcements, polls, etc.)

## User Flow
1. User logs in → popup appears
2. User reads content → clicks X to dismiss
3. Popup won't show again on this server (unless manually opened)
4. User clicks server icon → popup reopens

## Scope
Frontend-only feature. Backend already provides server metadata via existing API.
